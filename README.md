#### Extension features

-   **Single scan** of your buy orders for profitability (individual listings and commodity items). Marks each order with color: green = profitable, yellow = first in queue, red = unprofitable. Uses your configured thresholds. Adds flagged orders to the scan report at the end.
-   **Optional auto-cancellation** of risky orders. Controlled by scan options: "Cancel first in queue" and "Cancel if below (¬±%)".
-   Display **`market_listing_price_without_fee`** under the price of each lot on the item page.
-   Ability to **show more buy and sell orders** on item pages (for commodity items: sales). Quantity is configurable in the popup.
-   Show **number of lots purchased** out of the set quantity in each order on the main market page.
-   Show **totals of orders and listings** near headers on the main market page.
-   Show **last 24 hours sold quantity** under the median sales graph on item pages.
-   **Scan report**: view the last full scan report from the extension popup.
